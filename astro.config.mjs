  // Pages are emitted as directories (/guides/index.html), so /guides/ is the
  // canonical address and /guides only reaches it through a 308. Every internal
  // link was written without the slash, which meant every internal navigation
  // on the site paid a redirect round trip and the canonical URL itself had no
  // inbound links — an SEO audit read all 32 pages as orphans behind 32 Critical
  // redirects. The links are fixed; this stops them regressing, by making the
  // dev server refuse the slashless form instead of quietly serving it.

  // The redirect in config/nginx.conf stays regardless: it is what catches
  // inbound links from elsewhere, which we do not control.

  // Inline every stylesheet into the documents that use it rather than emitting
  // a render-blocking <link rel=stylesheet> per page. Safe under the CSP above:
  // Astro hashes the inlined <style> elements into the per-page <meta> policy.
  build: {
    inlineStylesheets: 'always',

  // Content Security Policy. Astro hashes every inline script and style it
  // emits and writes them into a <meta http-equiv> on each page. That is the
  // only mechanism that works here: the site has no external script files at
  // all — every script is small enough that Astro inlines it into the document
  // — so a fixed `script-src 'self'` header would block the theme toggle, the
  // menu and the scroll handler, and a hand-maintained hash list would go stale
  // on the next build.
  //
  // The site loads nothing off-origin: images come from astro:assets, fonts are
  // @fontsource (bundled), and Sanity is read at build time only. Hence 'self'
  // everywhere and 'none' for the things nothing uses — there are no forms, no
  // workers and no manifest. connect-src is 'self' rather than 'none': the
  // site still makes no fetch calls, so same-origin is all it would ever need,
  // and 'none' blocked audit tools that fetch /robots.txt from the page
  // context — Lighthouse reported "robots.txt is not valid" (SEO) because the
  // request itself was refused, not because the file was wrong.
  //
  // Two directives a <meta> CSP cannot carry — frame-ancestors, which every
  // browser ignores there, and HSTS, which is not CSP at all — live in
  // config/nginx.conf and public/_headers instead. Keep those in sync with this.

      // attributes unless 'unsafe-hashes' is present, and the hash would change
      // whenever a caller passes a different width.

  // No React. Nothing on the site is an island — the accordions and the menu
  // are <details>, the theme toggle and the phone screens are .astro — and the

  // ever referenced. Add it back the day something genuinely needs it:
  //
  //   pnpm add @astrojs/react react react-dom
  //   pnpm add -D @types/react @types/react-dom
  //
  // then re-add react() here and the jsx options to tsconfig.json. Note that
  // the feat/demo branch DOES have an island (DemoGarage.tsx), so it needs all
  // of the above restored before it can build against this config.
  // Sitemap: /404/ is a prerendered route but must never be listed, and every

  // Nothing on this site is authored in Markdown today — guides arrive as

  // `style` attributes that the CSP above cannot hash, and it warns about that
  // on every build. Prism emits class names instead, so the warning goes and a
